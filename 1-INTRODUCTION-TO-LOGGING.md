## Introduction to Logging 

### What is Logging?

- Logging is the process of capturing and storing information about an application's runtime behavior.
- It helps developers and system administrators to:
  - **Debug issues** during development.
  - **Monitor applications** in production environments.
  - **Audit actions** performed by a system or users.
  - **Analyze performance** for optimizing application behavior.

Logging provides visibility into how the application operates and helps identify potential bottlenecks or failures.
