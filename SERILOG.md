## Introduction to Serilog

### Why Serilog?

- Simplifies logging with a focus on **structured data** and human-readable logs.
- Perfect for debugging during development and monitoring applications in production.

### Key Features:

- **Multiple Sinks**: Outputs logs to the console, files, databases, or cloud services.
- **Structured Logging**: Includes contextual information (e.g., `UserId`, `TransactionId`) in logs.
- **Rich Ecosystem**: Integrates with Seq, Kibana, Azure, and other tools for advanced log analysis.
