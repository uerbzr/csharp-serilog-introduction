# Introduction to Serilog Sinks

Serilog **sinks** are output destinations for log events. They enable you to write logs to various storage formats, offering flexibility and extensibility. Common sinks include files, databases, cloud platforms, and monitoring dashboards. You can configure multiple sinks simultaneously, allowing logs to be sent to multiple destinations.

## Popular Sinks

- **File Sink**: Writes logs to disk files, ideal for permanent records.
- **Console Sink**: Outputs logs to the console, useful for debugging.
- **SQL Server**: Connects with Azure Application Insights for performance telemetry or direct to your db
- **Seq Sink**: Sends logs to a Seq server for structured querying and visualization.
- **Elasticsearch Sink**: Integrates with the ELK stack for powerful searching and visualization.
